Bringing energy production to your neighbourhood, we connect for a brighter tomorrow.

Energy production, storage, transportation and consumption can be decentralized. Neighbourhoods, buildings, and individual units can become energy self-sufficient through investment in energy infrastructure. 

## Production

Energy must be harvested by some means. This can be through the installation and maintenance of solar arrays, wind turbines, or some other means of energy production, such as tidal, gravitational, or geothermal production.

## Storage

Once produced, energy must be stored for later use. This will ideally be in a medium as energy-dense as possible to save on space requirements. Ideally (at the time of writing), this would be in the form of a Tesla Power Wall or some similar high-volume and high-density storage mechanism.

## Transportation

Once the energy has been produced and stored, it must be transported to the site of consumption. This may be achieved using either fixed or mobile means.

### Fixed Transportation

This would be achieved by setting up a local fixed connection between energy producers and energy consumers. Physical electric lines would have to be established between the energy storage device and the consumer connection.

### Mobile Transportation

This would be achieved by transferring energy stored in a larger immobile storage device at the production site to a smaller, higher-density storage device for transportation to the site of consumption. Energy expended to transport the energy capsule to the site of consumption would have to be factored in to the cost of the energy consumed. If an electric car could discharge its energy in reversed flow from the battery to its outlet, that mechanism could be used to transfer energy from one energy storage location to another.

## Consumption

In order to manage the whole ecosystem effectively and use the energy produced as prudently as possible, all participants in the grid would have to develop a better understanding of what their energy requirements are, and how they can reduce their consumption footprint. Each member would have to know how much energy they use per day, and how much energy each type of use consumes. For example, you might have heating, lighting, cooking, cleaning, and entertainment as consumption categories.
