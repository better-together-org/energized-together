# Production

Energy must be produced by some means before being consumed. Unfortunately, energy production infrastructure is expensive, so resources must be pooled to be able to afford to purchase them.

## Investment Bank

A financial investment bank must be created to invest in production infrastructure. A budget must be drawn up of cost per unit energy produced, and various production mechanisms should be considered. Evaluate the efficiency of solar and wind generation mechanisms based on their cost and how much electricity they generate per unit time.
