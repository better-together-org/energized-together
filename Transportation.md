# Transportation

Energy must be transported from the site of production to various storage locations for consumption. Energy may either be delivered via fixed link grid network, or via mobile transfer mechanisms. 

## Fixed link transfers

A local grid can be established around the site of production through a network of hard line connections. These will be bridged by a mesh network of system controllers reporting energy transfers from unit to unit on the network. 

## Mobile energy transfer

Energy can be transferred from larger immobile storage containers to smaller, higher-density storage solutions such as mobile power banks or electric vehicle batteries. The cost to transport the energy from one storage location to another for consumption must be considered for the cost of the energy transferred. Energy storage containers for mobile energy delivery should aim to be as high-density as possible per unit weight.
